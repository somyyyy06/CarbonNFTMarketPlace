# Get your GUI on!

It's not just standard sequential programs that Ghostwriter can help with, it is trainined with a full complement of program types which means that if we want to trek into the world of GUIs and event driven programming we can, with a ghostly hand being held as we go.


Erase the other code in `main.py` and add the comment below:

`#Create a simple log in page in TKinter that has a username and password field, as well as a 'log in' button to log in.`

Yeah, I'm sorry it's TKinter. Tkinter is horrible. But this goes to show Ghostwriter's prowess, as much as I hate writing GUIs in TKinter I can now bash through it at a rate of Knots because of the suggestions it makes.

Great first line suggestion, get the imports in there

Happy days! Ghostwriter created an easy login system with TKinter. It's even set a default username and password for us (although, I'm not sure what a default username and password combo of `admin` and `admin` says about the common work practice of us as a developer communityâ€¦)

### What TKinter GUI can you build?

#### _Can you make it look a bit less 1990s by using ghostwriter to style it? Maybe a prompt like `style it to look like a modern web app` might help?_
