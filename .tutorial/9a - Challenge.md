# Challenge

You didn't think that was it, did you?

At the end of each of these tutorials is a little challenge so you can stretch youself in building something with the epicness that is Ghostwriter.

Today's project combines a few of the examples we've looked at so  far, let's see how you get on!

## Get started:

You will be writing a program that will:
1. Scrape the headlines from a news website of your choice, using your web scraper of choice
2. Display at least 5 of the headlines in a simple TKinter GUI
3. Include a button that will append the list of headlines to a CSV file stored locally

### Hopefully this will be a quick five minute job for you, thanks to Ghostwriter!
